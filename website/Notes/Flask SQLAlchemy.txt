Setup:
In init.py
1) from flask_sqlalchemy import flask_sqlalchemy
2) db = SQLAlchemy()
   DB_NAME = ""
In create_app()
3) app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = f'sqlite:///{DB_NAME}' #f'' is just a formated string
4) db.init_app(app) #This just tells the database object to initialize the database with the app
5) from . import models #we put it just so we have the classes created so we can reference them here
   create_database(app)
6) we make the function create database outside the create_app() function still in init.py
   def create_database(app):
    if not path.exists('website/'+DB_NAME): #the name of the folder 
        db.create_all(app=app) #we need to tell SQLAlchemy which app to use, we have only one and it is called app
        print("Created Database!")

Then in models we start making the models. To make a model we need to use the db object.
We make a model by making a class that inherits db.Model
