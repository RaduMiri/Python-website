Jinja is a python framework that allows the usage of javascript functionality without using javascript, but pyhton instead
It is a templating language

!!Careful a block is actually space sensitive, like, the syntax has 2 spaces {%  %} and you write between these

if I put in the python viewer file a value that I pass with the return of the viewer to the template I am rendering, I can use the value in the template
Also, I can write if/else/elif blocks like this
auth.py:
@auth.route('/login')
def login():
    return render_template('login.html', boolean=True)

login.html
{% if boolean == True %}
Yes, it is True
{% else }
No, it is False
{% endif %}
